Not all web pages can be scrapped directly. Some are rendered through JavaScript. This project uses PyQt5 to rendered the page in background and scrapping was done using BeautfifulSoup4.

source-code: [here](https://github.com/aapaulng/js_scrap)

ps: Page rendering is slow. So if you are trying to scrap multiple website. The best approach is to use multiprocessing and threading.

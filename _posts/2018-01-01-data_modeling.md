I attended [ADAX](http://adax.asia/datastar/) Data Scientist programme for the past two months.
Learned a lot on data modeling. I rewrote some of the notes with my own understanding.
This project is focusing on Python library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/)

Codes are written in Jupyter Notebook: [here](https://github.com/aapaulng/data_modeling)

It includes :
- Regression technique(Linear/Logistic)
- Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
- Supervised ML
- etc (more to come)
